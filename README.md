To implement authentication using Context API

To manage product data using Redux Toolkit

To integrate Context API and Redux Toolkit in a single application

Software / Tools Required

Visual Studio Code

Node.js

React JS

Redux Toolkit

Web Browser

Theory

State management is an important aspect of React applications. The Context API is used to manage global states such as user authentication, login status, and roles without prop drilling. Redux Toolkit provides a simplified and efficient approach to manage complex application states like product catalogs and cart data. By combining Context API for authentication and Redux Toolkit for product management, the application becomes more scalable, modular, and easier to maintain.

Result

Authentication state was successfully managed using React Context API, and product state was effectively handled using Redux Toolkit. Both state management techniques were integrated successfully in the React application.
